# Inspiration ðŸ’¡
I wanted to create a privacy centric chat application. As you already know, our chats on most of the applications use our chats to show us personalized ads. So I wanted to create something which doesn't store any data from my users. This application's data should be deleted as the members leave the chat.

# How I built it ðŸ› 
This was my first application which I built while learning Back-end development. I used Node.js for its application environment. I used Express.js for the application framework of the application. Express is helpful for synchronizing frontend and backend parts of the web application. Also, I used websocket for emitting and receiving the messages from multiple users.

# Challenges I ran into ðŸ¤’
The biggest challenge was to learn websockets, which is a very large, bidirectional communication protocol. I had to dive deep down in the docs of socket.io. Also, rendering new messages to the interface was a very big challenge.

# What I learnt ðŸ“š
 I learnt a lot of Backend development and different technologies. I have now learnt Node.js, Express.js and websockets. I can now use these newly learnt technologies to create more amazing and interesting applications.

# What's next for Instant Chat Application ðŸ™Œ
Adding support for images is the next step in this application. Also, improving the UI and UX of this application is another thing which I'll be working on.
